        firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(displayName, userEmail, userPass)

        : in the example above, when i began to type userPass, I wished that the program would have known that I was going to type userPass, since I had already typed userEmail....) 

        it would be cool if the program categorized them into a pattern,
        saying, "these are the only two variables like this (ex: userSomething, userAnything)" 
        therefore, the programmer most likely wants the other one next.
